# Magic Spell - Spelling Practice App for Kids

## Project Overview
A React web app to help kids practice weekly spelling words through interactive exercises and tests. Parents can upload word lists, and kids can practice with games and take pre-tests with AI voice pronunciation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility classes only)
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth)
- **Hosting**: Netlify
- **Text-to-Speech**: Web Speech API (browser native)

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Use arrow functions for components and handlers
- Keep components under 300 lines - extract if larger
- Use destructuring for props and state
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use template literals for string concatenation
- Add comments for complex logic only, keep code self-documenting

## Supabase Integration
- All database operations go through `services/supabase.js`
- Never expose Supabase keys in client code
- Use the pre-built service functions: `wordListService`, `testResultService`, `feedbackService`
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch

## Component Guidelines
- Components should be single-responsibility
- Parent components manage state, children receive props
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic (like `useSpeech`)
- Keep UI feedback clear for kids (big buttons, clear messages)

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind utility classes only (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Design for kids: large text, bright colors, clear buttons
- Mobile-friendly (kids might use tablets)
- Use semantic colors: green for correct, red/yellow for incorrect, blue for actions

## Kid-Friendly UX Principles
- Large, clickable targets (buttons should be big)
- Clear audio feedback (speak words clearly and slowly)
- Immediate visual feedback on actions
- Positive reinforcement (celebrate successes)
- Simple navigation (minimal clicks to get to practice/test)
- Forgiving error handling (let kids try again easily)

## Parent-Friendly Admin Principles
- Quick word list entry (paste from anywhere)
- Clear active/inactive states
- Easy to set up weekly words
- Progress tracking visibility

## Database Schema
**word_lists**: id, created_at, name, words (jsonb), is_active
**test_results**: id, created_at, word_list_id, score, total, details (jsonb)
**Storage Buckets**: voice-clips, feedback-images

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing in browser
- Test with actual kids to validate UX
- Check speech synthesis across browsers (Chrome/Safari/Firefox)
- Verify mobile responsiveness

## Common Patterns

### Supabase Query
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('field', value);

if (error) throw error;
return data;
```
